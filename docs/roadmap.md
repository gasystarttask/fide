# 📖 Bible AI Engine: RAG + Knowledge Graph Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the development of a semantic search and chat engine for the Bible, leveraging **DocumentDB (Postgres-backed)**, **LangChain**, and **Next.js**.

---

## 🏗️ Phase 1: Data Infrastructure & Vectorization
*Focus: Turning raw XML into a searchable vector database.*

- ✅ **Project Scaffolding** (Next.js 14+, Tailwind, TypeScript) `done`
- ✅ **XML Parser Service** (Transforming CES XML to JSON segments) `done`
- ✅ **DocumentDB Connection** (Setting up pg_documentdb / pgvector) `done`
- ✅ **Vector Ingestion Pipeline** (OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` + LangChain) `done`
- ✅ **Semantic Search API** (Basic similarity search endpoint) `done`

---

## 🕸️ Phase 2: Knowledge Graph Extraction
*Focus: Building the relational layer (People, Places, Events).*

- ✅ **Entity Extraction Schema** (Zod definitions for Persons/Locations) `done`
- ✅ **LLM Extraction Pipeline** (Processing key books: Genesis, Gospels, Acts) `done`
- ✅ **Graph Database Population** (Populating `entities` and `relations` collections) `done`
- ✅ **Entity Resolution** (Merging "Jesus", "Christ", and "Lord" into a single ID) `done`

---

## 🧠 Phase 3: RAG Orchestration & AI Logic
*Focus: Creating the "Brain" using LangChain and Vercel AI SDK.*

- ✅ **Hybrid Retriever** (Combining Vector Search + Graph Traversal) `done` — Adaptive fanout, RRF fusion, entity enrichment
- ✅ **Agentic Router** (US-009: Logic to decide between semantic search or genealogy graph) `done` — Intent classification, kinship fast profile, French LSG support
- ✅ **Context Injection** (US-010: System prompts for theological accuracy and sourcing) `done` — Grounded answers, citation validation, anti-hallucination
- ✅ **Streaming API Handlers** (US-011: Real-time token streaming with SSE) `done` — AI SDK UI-message streams backed by provider factory + fallback executor

- ✅ **LLM Provider Factory Rollout** `done` — Runtime routing, grounded answers, chat streaming, and extraction scripts now share Copilot/OpenAI/Gemini/Ollama selection and fallback policy

---

## 🎨 Phase 4: Frontend & User Experience
*Focus: A clean, scholarly, and responsive chat interface.*

- ✅ **Chat Interface** (Streaming support with incremental rendering) `done` — SSE UI + loading skeleton
- ✅ **Citation System** (Clickable verse references linked to source text) `done` — Interactive citations with verse preview
- ✅ **Knowledge Graph Preview** (UI components to show "Related Entities") `done` — Entity chips, relation snippets, focused follow-up search
- 📥 **Performance Optimization** (Edge runtime & Postgres indexing) `to-do`

---

## 🚀 Deployment & Scaling
- 📥 **Database Migration** (Production instance on AWS/Azure/Supabase) `to-do`
- 📥 **Vercel Deployment** (CI/CD setup) `to-do`
